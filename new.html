<p> <br>Paul William Walker IV[1] (September 12, 1973[2] â€“ November 30, 2013)
    was an American actor. He was best known for his role as Brian O'Conner in the Fast & Furious franchise.
<br><br><br>
   Paul Walker began his career as a child actor in the 1980s, gaining recognition 
   in the 1990s after appearing in the television soap opera The Young and the Restless;
   he received praise for his performances in the teen comedy She's All That and the comedy-drama 
   Varsity Blues (both 1999), and saw international fame by starring in The Fast and the Furious (2001).
   <br><br><br>
   He also starred in the commercially successful road thriller Joy Ride (2001), becoming an
   action star. He followed this with the box-office disappointments Into the Blue (2005) and 
   Running Scared (2006), although he earned praise for his performance in the survival drama Eight Below,
   and for his portrayal of Hank Hansen in Flags of Our Fathers (both 2006). Outside of these,
   Walker largely appeared in low budget action films, but starred in the commercially successful
   heist film Takers (2010).
    <br> <br><br>  
    Walker was also set to play Agent 47 
   in the film adaptation Hitman: Agent 47 (2015),
   but died before production began.[23] It was later
   revealed Walker declined the role of Superman in
   Superman Returns (2006), allegedly due to the "Superman curse" 
   and the celebrity associated with the role.
   <br><br><br>
   He held a brown belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu 
   under Ricardo "Franjinha" Miller at Paragon Jiu-Jitsu[36][37] 
   and was awarded his black belt by Miller posthumously.[38] Walker
   founded the humanitarian aid nonprofit charity Reach Out Worldwide
   (ROWW) with financial adviser Roger Rodas in response to the 2010 Haiti
   earthquake.[39][40] He traveled to a number of disaster-stricken areas
   to supply aid until his death.
   <br><br><br>
    On November 30, 2013, at about 3:30 p.m. PST,
    Walker, 40, and Roger Rodas, 38, left an event for Walker's 
    charity Reach Out Worldwide for victims of Typhoon Haiyan,
    with Rodas driving his red 2005 Porsche Carrera GT.[53] Traveling 
    between 80 mph (130 km/h) and 93 mph (150 km/h) in a 45 mph (72 km/h) 
    speed zone on Hercules Street in Valencia, a neighborhood of Santa Clarita,
    California, the car ended up crashed into a concrete lamp post and two trees,
    catching fire.[52][54] Rodas died of multiple trauma while Walker died 
    from the combined effects of trauma and burns. Both of their bodies were
    burned beyond recognition.[
